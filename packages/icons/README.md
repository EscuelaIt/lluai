# Lluai Icons

**Lluai Icons** is a Web Components implementation of the [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev) library — a beautiful, consistent set of open-source icons.
This package allows you to use Lucide icons as **standard JavaScript Web Components**, without depending on any framework.

---

## 🚀 Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install lluai-icons
```

---

## 📦 Usage

Each icon is available as an independent Web Component that can be imported individually.

### Example

```js
import 'lluai-icons/components/house.js';
```

Then use it directly in your HTML:

```html
<lluai-icon-house></lluai-icon-house>
```

That’s it — the icon will render inline
